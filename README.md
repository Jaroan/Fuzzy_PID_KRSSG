Abstract

The traditional Mamdani approach of Fuzzy Logic is computationally expensive and highly inefficient when it comes to controlling velocity and direction of motion of bots which need to have fast response as well as acquire accurate target states with minimal error. Added to this, it is necessary to take into consideration the means of communication, which in our case is via a wireless network. In this paper we propose a modified version of the Mamdani approach and then proceed to integrate it with a PID control function in an attempt to achieve better results.

Introduction:
	
DC motors in general do not have a linear rpm-pwm relationship. The reasons for this include friction in the axle and back emf as well as external influences like resistive torque from the load or fluctuating voltages. But more often than not, we would like the motor to run at the same speed or to provide the same torque irrespective of the conditions it is run in or the load it is required to carry. It is imperative that given a target state, the motor may require different PWM values to reach that state subject to different conditions. Therefore, an automated non-linear correction function is essential to provide optimal outputs in any arbitrary condition.

One of the most popular industrial control systems used is the PID control logic.
	Y(t)  = Kpe(t) + Kie(t)dt + Kdde/dt
where  e(t) is the error at sampling time time t and de is the change in error. 
Kp, Ki and Kd can be tuned to provide optimal performance. One widely used method is the Zeigler-Nicholas method. 
Unfortunately, tuning the PID controller for best performance is quite time consuming. That is why, an automated control function which bypasses this tuning process and automatically optimizes Kp, Ki and Kd would be very helpful.

In our case, we implemented a PD controller with fuzzy logic for running our motors.

First, the membership functions and linguistic definitions are determined to capture the desired dynamics. Once these are determined, the implementation of the controller is achieved by directly applying existing techniques. However, the determination of these rules and definitions are not obvious for complex systems, but they are critical to the performance of the controller.


As shown above, a general fuzzy logic controller consists of four parts:

Fuzzification which involves taking inputs from the sensors and fuzzifying them for further processing. The fuzzified sets express measurement uncertainties.
Knowledge base where the rules are formed using linguistic variables.
The fuzzified measurements are then used by the inference engine to evaluate the rules stored in the fuzzy rule base and a fuzzified output is determined.
The fuzzified output is then converted to a single crisp value. This conversion is called defuzzification. The defuzzified values represent the actions to be taken by the FLC in controlling the process.


Our fuzzy controller takes as input the error and change in error and outputs Kp and Kd.
These new values are fed into a PD function which computes the required PWM.



Fuzzification:

PE, ZE, NE, PDE, NDE and ZDE were initialized to zero.
Then the values were updated according to the input membership functions shown above. Here we used 10 as an indication of full membership in order to reduce computational complexity.  

Creating the Fuzzy Matrix ( Rule Base ):

3x3 matrix used:
For simplification, a 3*3 Rule Base Matrix was implemented for each of the Kp Controller and Kd Controller.



Defuzzification:

The Defuzzification includes setting the following parameters:
 


PD-Control:
	

Variable Initializations:

The constants for the proportional, integral and derivative are initialized to some values:
Kp_Small_Val = 1, Kp_Medium_Val = 2, Kp_Large_Val = 3,
Kd_Small_Val = 3, Kd_Medium_Val = 6, Kd_Large_Val = 9;
All other variables are initialized to zero.

Functions Used:

void Initialise_LED()
This is the basic function for the STMâ€™s LED initialization

void Initialise_UART()
This function defines the specifications of the UART used in the STM for communication
UART4 was used
Size of data transmitted was 8 bit words

void Initialise_NVIC()
Interrupt handler

void Compute_Error()
Computes the error and difference of previous error

void Error_Fuzzification()
This function fuzzifies error and d_error into the three linguistic variables NE, ZE and PE and NDE, ZDE and PDE respectively.

void Create_Fuzzy_Matrix()
This function assigns values to the 3x3 fuzzy matrix using the NE, ZE, PE, PDE, ZDE and NDE v


void Defuzzification()
This function is responsible for computing the crisp values of Kp and Kd from the created fuzzy matrix.

volatile int Fuzzy_PID()
This function is responsible for calculating the resultant PWM
Currently suited for controlling motion in one direction only. 

void UART4_IRQHandler()
Receives ticks in the range(0-127) and outputs PWM(0-127)
127 PWM corresponds to full PWM to be supplied to the motor driver.

main(void)
Here the initialization functions are called once
First PWM data is sent and the next iteration happens when a value is received by the interrupt handler which in turn calls the fuzzy functions.
